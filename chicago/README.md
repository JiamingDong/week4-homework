# Week 4 Homework

This is the last homework assignment of the quarter!  Isn't this sad? :-)

FORK this repository before you start.

DUE: You must push your code to GitHub no later than **Thursday, April 30 at 5:29PM**.

### Overview

This app "works" - but it's implementation violates HTTP best practices.

Your job is to clean up the code so that it follows best practices for RESTful design.

When you are done, the app should still work the same from the user's perspective, along with a couple of enhancements.

Go through every component of Rails and change the code to confirm to best practices:

1. (3 pts) Make sure your routes follow the "Golden 7" HTTP method/URL conventions.  (The lone exception is the `root` route.)
1. (3 pts) Make sure your controllers follow the "Golden 7" action naming conventions.
1. (3 pts) Make sure your views transmit requests using the proper HTTP methods.

Finally, you can earn 1 point for code readability and style.  Make sure your variable names are good, and your indentation is consistent and clean, in all files - routes, controllers, and views.

Happy coding!
